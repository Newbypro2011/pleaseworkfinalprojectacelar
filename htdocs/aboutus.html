    <h1>About the Organization:</h1>
    <img src="/media/reallogo.png" alt="">
    <div>Mangrove Matters was formed as a result of collaboration among environmentally concerned individuals within the City of Davao. This collaboration eventually grew into a full-sized community of 200 people who have a shared passion for preserving the
        natural treasures of Davao City. As people who witnessed firsthand the rapid loss of mangrove forests and its impact on livelihoods, the community was determined to make a difference. Initially, it started as small gatherings to plant mangrove
        seedlings in the coastal areas of Lasang and Matina Aplaya. These efforts paved the way for Mangrove Matters to evolve into a broader advocacy movement focused on raising awareness, educating the public, and partnering with local governments.

        Today, Mangrove Matters stands as a respected community for mangrove conservation in the city. We collaborate with environmental scientists, community leaders, and policymakers to develop solutions towards sustainable development. Our story reflects the
        power of passion, collaboration, and initiative amongst individuals that can result in more successful outcomes.
