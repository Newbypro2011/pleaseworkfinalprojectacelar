    <h1>A Case Study on Mangrove Wetlands in Davao City</h1>
    <div>Mangrove Forests in Davao City have experienced a significant decline over the past decades. Since the 1940s, mangrove ecosystems have shrunk from 471 hectares to only about 24.86 hectares by 2021. This sharp decrease is due to the rapid urban development
        along the city's coastal areas, distrupting the natural habitats in these forests. The continuous expansion of infrastructure has not only reduced the physical area for mangroves to thrive, but also to maintain their ecological balance (GMA Network
        | News and Entertainment, n.d.). </div>

        The remaining mangrove areas in Davao City such as those in Barangay Lasang, face ongoing challenges due to unstable conditions. These forests suffer from a lack of species diversity and natural regeneration which are worsened due to insufficient efforts
        from Local Government Units. The decline of these mangrove ecosystems pose serious environmental and economical issues, making coastal areas more prone to storm surges and the lack of breeding grounds for fishes. All of these directly impacts
        the city's fishery industry which also affects local livelihoods and market prices (Home | Philippine Center for Population and Development, n.d.).

    <div><img src="/media/mangrov.jpg" height="500" width="500" alt="image bracket"> In order to address this, the city has taken several active measures towards Mangrove rehabilitation. Such of these actions could be seen through community-based mangrove
        regeneration, new environmental laws, and partnerships with private companies. In Barangay Lasang, significant efforts since 2013 has doubled their mangrove forests from 22 hectares to 44 hectares as of 2025. (GMA Network | News and Entertainment,
        n.d.) Local Community groups such as “Bantay-Dagat” participate in engaging the youth in mangrove planting activities in order to advocate for sustainable practices. These actions were the outcomes of the new zoning and environmental ordinance
        which protects these ecosystems within the city from reclamation and alteration. (Lgauthor, 2025) Various other organizations including the Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources (BFAR), local schools, and private companies such as Petron also
        host mangrove planting activities to support mangrove regeneration in the city. (Enverga, 2025)</div>
